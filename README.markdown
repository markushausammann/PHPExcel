This is a mirror of the PHPExcel library by [CodePlex](http://phpexcel.codeplex.com). The mirror doesn't contain documentation or tests.

This mirror has been created to make PHPExcel installable with [Composer](http://packagist.org/).

If you would like to install PHPExcel as a [Composer](http://packagist.org/) package, add a file called `composer.json` to the root of your project and add the following:

    {
        "require": {
            "CodePlex/PHPExcel": "1.7.6"
        }
    }

If you already have a `composer.json` file, just add an attitional requirement for PHPExcel.
